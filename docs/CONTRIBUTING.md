Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## How to contribute to mkdocs

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
 in mkdocs**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](./SECURITY.md).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fga-eps-mds/2022-2-Squad07/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fga-eps-mds/2022-2-Squad07/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the our [Standards](https://fga-eps-mds.github.io/2022-2-Squad07/code_conduct.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of mkdocs will generally not be accepted.

mkdocs is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks! - *mkdocs Team* -
